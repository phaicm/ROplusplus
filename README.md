C/C++ functions to work with resource data from Ragnarok Online game client

Just that, I'm using them for a private project but I've decided to share them here. They are still incomplete but I believe they work well enough atm. I will improve them as long as I need more features and the like.

I'd like to thank to people who shared their previous research which allowed me to write this code, they were:

*   The Ximosoft dude, author of Ragnarok Online Laboratory ([http://rolaboratory.ximosoft.com/](http://rolaboratory.ximosoft.com/)) where you can find data about file formats.
    
*   FlavioJS, contributor of both _eAthena_ and _Open Ragnarok_ projects, who also shared his research about the file formats ([http://eathena-project.googlecode.com/svn/devel/FlavioJS/](http://eathena-project.googlecode.com/svn/devel/FlavioJS/))
    
*   Gratia and deufeufeu, who also documented about the ACT file format ([http://mist.in/gratia/ro/spr/ActFileFormatFix.html](http://mist.in/gratia/ro/spr/ActFileFormatFix.html))
    

**\-- Disclaimer --**

Ragnarok Online is an awesome Korean game by Gravity Corp. We're not affiliated to Gravity Corp. or whatsoever. If you want to play the actual game, you should download it from the official Ragnarok Online website at ([http://www.ragnarokonline.com/](http://www.ragnarokonline.com/)). This project is only meant for people learning (game)programming and C, who would like to have a grasp of what's going on under the covers of the game they play. By no means its intended to steal or whatever intellectual property issues you want to claim.

Anyway if Gravity feels this as a danger for their product, given their coding sucks and I can do better by myself with no money other than for eating every day, I would gladly accept to join their development team. As project leader and head developer, of course.

Regards, The project leader.

phaicm edit: 

I'm just archiving RO history. Too lazy to convert SVN to github so I rename .svn to _svn.
